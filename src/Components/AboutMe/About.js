        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Fabian Villase√±or, a Front End Web Developer. I began coding when I found a FREE coding academy teaching web development using Angular only five minutes away in Modesto, California.
          I had never coded before so I was intimidated at first, however once I started learning I was hooked! Since my completion of the bootcamp I have continued my coding journey by learning new things and creating projects, some of which you can find below!
          Some tools I have used to create these projects are React, Javascript, Angular, MySQL, REST APIs, jsonwebtoken, and Node.js
